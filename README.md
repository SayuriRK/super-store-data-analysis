# Data analysis of a super store in USA using Python and Pandas
This is my first attempt to do a data analysis using a dataset, Python and Pandas. The project I based on is called "An√°lise de dados com Python e Pandas" on the Digital Innovation One platform, taught by the instructor Fernanda Santos.

In this project I was able to:

* Import csv file
* Check shape of the table, type of the columns and search for null values
* Check and drop unused columns from the table
* Generate descriptive statistics
* Use arithmetic operators
* Create new columns
* Use combination of columns
* Plot graph and configurate it
* Save new csv file
